ECOREGION CASE STUDY: CntlPlains
Correlation Analysis: Flash Droughts vs Agricultural Economics
Analysis Period: 2000-2024
Generated: 2025-10-15 12:08:22

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================
• Target Ecoregion: CntlPlains
• Average Annual Flash Drought Events: 412.3
• Average Annual Harvested Acres: 16.02 million
• Average Annual Insurance Indemnities: $3.73 billion
• Average Loss Ratio: 264.3%

KEY CORRELATIONS
================
• SFD vs Insurance: r = 0.252 (p = 0.224) 
• SFD vs Acres: r = 0.017 (p = 0.935) 
• SFD vs LossRatio: r = 0.188 (p = 0.368) 
• Acres vs Insurance: r = -0.237 (p = 0.254) 
• SFD vs IndemnityPerAcre: r = 0.129 (p = 0.538) 


CORRELATION INTERPRETATION
=========================
• Flash Droughts vs Insurance Claims: r = 0.252
  - Weak correlation
  - More flash droughts weakly associated with higher insurance payouts

• Flash Droughts vs Harvested Acres: r = 0.017
  - Positive relationship between droughts and agricultural activity
  
• Flash Droughts vs Loss Ratio: r = 0.188
  - Drought events increase insurance program efficiency

EXTREME YEARS
=============
• Highest Flash Drought Activity: 2012 (856 events)
• Highest Insurance Payouts: 2020 ($4.75 billion)

TEMPORAL PATTERNS
=================
• Flash Drought Trend: +1.61 events/year
• Insurance Claims Trend: $-2.11 million/year
• Harvested Acres Trend: +12.28 thousand acres/year


KEY FINDINGS
============
• Flash drought frequency shows increasing trend over analysis period
• Insurance indemnities decrease by $2.1 million annually
• Agricultural area shows expansion trend
• Correlation patterns suggest weak climate-agriculture linkages

ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS
====================
• Flash droughts represent significant economic risk to CntlPlains agriculture
• Insurance program serves as critical risk management tool
• Regional agricultural adaptation may be needed for climate resilience
• Economic losses from droughts extend beyond direct crop damage

METHODOLOGY
===========
• Flash drought events from SFD dataset (AGGECOREGION classification)
• Crop insurance data aggregated by ecoregion and year
• Agricultural production data from NASS-style analysis
• Pearson correlation coefficients with significance testing
• Temporal trend analysis using linear regression
