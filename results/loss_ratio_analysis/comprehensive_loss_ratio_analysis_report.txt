KEY FINDINGS
============
• Loss ratios vary significantly across ecoregions (2.39 to 2.74)
• Flash drought events show negative correlation with loss ratios
• Regression model explains 4.6% of loss ratio variance
• Increasing trend in loss ratios over analysis period
• Drought intensity is more predictive than event count alone

ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS
====================
• High loss ratios indicate significant federal subsidy of agricultural risk
• Flash drought events contribute to insurance program stress
• Regional risk patterns suggest need for differentiated premium structures
• Climate change may be affecting traditional actuarial assumptions
• Ecoregional analysis reveals geographic concentration of risk

RECOMMENDATIONS
===============
• Monitor high-risk ecoregions for premium adequacy
• Consider drought forecasting in risk assessment models
• Develop region-specific risk management strategies
• Investigate causes of high volatility in certain ecoregions
• Enhance early warning systems for flash drought events

METHODOLOGY
===========
• Loss ratios calculated as indemnities/premiums by ecoregion and year
• Flash drought events from SFD dataset with AGGECOREGION classification
• Correlation analysis using Pearson coefficients with significance testing
• Multiple regression with standardized features
• Temporal trend analysis using linear regression
• Risk assessment based on average loss ratios and volatility measures
